## Key Talking Points

### For ULTRA Demo:

**Opening:**
"This ULTRA demo shows not just what we have, but what we can build once we have the API token. Everything you're about to see is possible - it's just a matter of prioritizing what adds the most value."

**Smart Alerts:**
"Imagine getting an alert that Project X is about to go over budget - BEFORE it happens. Or knowing which employees are approaching overtime so you can rebalance the workload. That's proactive management."

**Cost Tracking:**
"With real-time cost data, we know immediately if a project is profitable. No waiting for end-of-month reports. We can make decisions today based on what's happening today."

**Overtime Prediction:**
"Overtime is expensive. This system predicts who will hit OT by tracking weekly hours and sending alerts at 35 hours - giving us time to adjust before we're paying time-and-a-half."

**Future Features:**
"This roadmap shows everything that's possible. Some features we can build in days, some take weeks. We'll prioritize based on what saves the most time and money. What would be most valuable to you?"

**Closing:**
"The demo you saw at the beginning - that's ready today. This ULTRA demo - that's 30-90 days away with the API token. The question is: which features do we build first?"
