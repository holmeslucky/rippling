## PRESENTATION TIPS

**Before Starting:**
- Have all three demos ready (test beforehand)
- Load web demo in browser tab
- Have backup if internet fails (local demos)
- Print QUICK_START_GUIDE.md as handout

**During Presentation:**
- Let demos speak for themselves
- Don't rush through features
- Pause for questions after each demo
- Show real project names (25-2126, etc.) to make it tangible
- Emphasize "ready now" vs "future vision"

**Key Phrases to Use:**
- "This is running live right now"
- "Production-ready today"
- "No waiting for end-of-month reports"
- "Catch problems before they cost money"
- "Proactive instead of reactive"
- "Know profitability instantly"

**What NOT to Say:**
- Don't oversell features not yet built
- Don't promise specific dates without confirming
- Don't minimize complexity (but emphasize it's handled)

---

## CLOSING STATEMENT

"We've shown you three versions of this system:

**Standard** - Simple enough for daily use by any foreman
**Enhanced** - Powerful enough for management decision-making
**ULTRA** - Complete enough to transform how we run projects

The foundation is built. The demos are live. The ROI is clear.

The question isn't whether this adds value - it clearly does.

The question is: which features do we prioritize first?

Let's discuss what matters most to Capitol Engineering and make this happen."
