Financial intelligence per project:
- Labor cost calculation (hours × labor rate)
- Billed amount (hours × billing rate)
- Profit margin (percentage)
- Budget usage (visual progress bars)

## PRESENTATION STRATEGIES

### Strategy 1: Progressive Reveal
1. Start with Standard (5 min) - "Here's the basics"
2. Show Enhanced (5 min) - "Here's the analytics"
3. Finish with ULTRA (10 min) - "Here's the vision"
4. Close: "All of this is possible with the API token"

### Strategy 2: Audience-Specific
- **Foremen only:** Standard Demo
- **Management/IT:** Enhanced Demo
- **Executives:** ULTRA Demo

### Strategy 3: The Big Reveal (Recommended)
1. Start with ULTRA (blow them away with vision)
2. Fall back to Enhanced (show what's ready now)
3. Reference Standard (show how simple it is for users)
4. Close: "Which features matter most to you?"

## TALKING POINTS

### Opening (ULTRA Demo)
"This ULTRA demo shows not just what we have, but what we can build once we have the API token. Everything you're about to see is possible - it's just a matter of prioritizing what adds the most value to Capitol Engineering."

### Smart Alerts
"Imagine getting an alert that Project 25-2126 is about to go over budget - BEFORE it happens. Or knowing which employees are approaching overtime so you can rebalance the workload. That's proactive management instead of reactive firefighting."

### Cost Tracking
"With real-time cost data, we know immediately if a project is profitable. No waiting for end-of-month reports. We can make decisions today based on what's happening today. This project shows 62% profit margin - that's great. This other one shows 15% - we need to investigate why."

### Overtime Prediction
"Overtime is expensive - time-and-a-half adds up fast. This system predicts who will hit OT by tracking weekly hours and sending alerts at 35 hours - giving us 5 hours to adjust schedules before we're paying premium rates."

### Future Features
"This roadmap shows everything that's possible. Some features we can build in days, some take weeks. We'll prioritize based on what saves the most time and money. What would be most valuable to you?"

### Closing
"The Standard demo you saw - that's ready today. The Enhanced demo with analytics - that's ready today and live on the web right now. This ULTRA demo showing cost tracking and AI insights - that's 30-90 days away with the API token. The question is: which features do we build first?"

## ROI JUSTIFICATION

### Time Savings
- **Automated reports:** 2-3 hours/week saved
- **Real-time cost tracking:** 5 hours/week saved
- **Overtime prediction:** 2 hours/week saved
- **Total:** 9-10 hours/week = $10,000-15,000/year

### Cost Savings
- **Budget overrun prevention:** $5,000-10,000/year
- **Overtime reduction:** $5,000-15,000/year
- **Improved profit margins (5-10%):** $20,000-50,000/year
- **Total:** $30,000-75,000/year potential

### Revenue Gains
- **Better data** = Better estimates = Win more profitable bids
- **Cost control** = Higher margins = More profit per job
- **Efficiency** = Handle more projects = Revenue growth
- **Total Value:** $50,000-100,000+/year potential
